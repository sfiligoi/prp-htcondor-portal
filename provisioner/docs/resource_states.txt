Pod Cluster
===========
All pods will be wrapped in a Job abstraction.
Each job can have 1 or more Pods associated with it.

Note that a Job can fail at the beginning (without submitting any pods), but that's an exceptional case.
The Job wrapper could re-start failed Pods, but we will not use that feature, as the errors are likely un-recoverable.
A job is Completed when all of the pods have completed.


Pod states
==========
Each pod goes through the following states:
Pending  -(exception)-> Failed
V              ^
Starting (Image pull, etc.)
V
Initializing (Running, but not yet next stage)
V
Registered (HTCondor collector sees it)
V  ^
Claimed
V
Completed (Auto shut-down)
